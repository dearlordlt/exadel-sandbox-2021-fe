            In our competitive Sandbox program, about 65% of each class will win professional position with us. Here, as part of our
            development team, internships work closely with experienced engineers to quickly deepen their skills through real-world work in
            coding, development, design and testing. Being part of a consultancy organization, a strong emphasis on teamwork is also part of
            every internship's experience. Interested in learning more?
